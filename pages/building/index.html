                With an ever-growing demand for data and critical services that must maintain operation all day, every day, 365 days of the year, the power network supporting the servers, switches and climate control functions has to
be robust and resilient. Scheduled downtime must be kept to a minimum. Data centre power cable requirements run from the energy grids all the way into server rooms, connecting sub- stations with MV cables to generators and transformers stepping down to LV power when it enters the building
to power HVAC, fire suppression systems and the data centre servers themselves. Increasingly, data centre
operators look for eco-friendly, carbon-neutral solutions to the power-intensive demands of the building, so
