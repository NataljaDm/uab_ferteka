                With an ever-growing demand for data and critical services that must maintain operation all day, every
                day, 365 days of the year, the power network supporting the servers, switches and climate control
                functions has to
                be robust and resilient. Scheduled downtime must be kept to a minimum. Data centre power cable
                requirements run from the energy grids all the way into server rooms, connecting sub- stations with MV
                cables to generators and transformers stepping down to LV power when it enters the building
                to power HVAC, fire suppression systems and the data centre servers themselves. Increasingly, data
                centre
                operators look for eco-friendly, carbon-neutral solutions to the power-intensive demands of the
                building, so
